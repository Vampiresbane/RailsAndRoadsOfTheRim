/*
Nice looking cartridge-style option picker 
Layout : 1 vertical cartridge per type of buidalble road
Each cartridge has :
- A square image at the top, representing the type of road
- The name of the road below
- A list of costs, one per line :
> Work
> WoodLog
> Stone
> Steel
> Chemfuel
> etc..   
Each line starts with the icon of the resource (work uses the construction site icon)
Upon clicking outside, the cartridge is closed with no further actions
Upon clicking on a road icon, we set the roaddef of the site to that road and start targeting the map to add legs

Check, among others :
* Widgets many methods
