    Nice looking cartridge-style option picker 
    Layout : 1 vertical cartridge per type of buidalble road
    Each cartridge has :
    - A square image at the top, representing the type of road
    - The name of the road below
    - A list of costs, one per line :
    > Work
    > WoodLog
    > Stone
    > Steel
    > Chemfuel
    > etc..   
    Each line starts with the icon of the resource (work uses the construction site icon)
    Upon clicking outside, the cartridge is closed with no further actions
    Upon clicking on a road icon, we set the roaddef of the site to that road and start targeting the map to add legs

    Check, among others :
    * Widgets many methods
